## Notes

### Summary

This setup consists of three elements: 1) the [[YYYY-MM-DD|daily note]], 2) the [[log1|filtered views]] (logs), and 3) the navigational aspects (links).

### Navigation
Each log and daily note contains an embed of [[nav]], which contains links to each log. The links are contained in a collapsed callout.

### Dataview Queries
[[log1]], [[log2]], and [[log3]] each use three different relevant queries. [[log3]] uses an inline field in each entry to yield narrower filters. 

`[field:: key]` and `(field:: key)` are both inline queries but either show both the values of the field and the key or only the key.

### Template
The most important is the [[label]] template, which adds a link-label to every journal entry. The link-label makes the entry register in that log's Dataview query and allows you to easily navigate corresponding log. Hotkey for template (Windows):  `Ctrl + X`

### Integrating this into your vault

When making the Test Vault, I wanted it to be used as a **reference**, so the process of integrating this vault to your current one will look kinda like this: 
1. Creation of the main folders (2): "logs", "journal", etc. 
2. Installation of plugins: check the plugins section in the Test Vault settings.
3. Propagation of the necessary pages: the templates (3) in your Templates folder, a [[Journal]] page, and a customized [[nav]] page. 
4. Et cetera: the creation of logs and the modification of the label template according to your choosing with this vault as reference.

**[STOP HERE IF YOU JUST WANT THE SETUP]**

### Notes on journaling, and how it meshes with my note-taking in Obsidian

My notes are a linearized form of my thinking. Being so refined, they don't seep potential or feed curiosity in a way that a less well-written, subconscious piece would. My journal is situated in such a way to convey this gulf between my notes and my mind with something in between to preserve and distribute horrible pieces of interesting writing that make me excited to both explore a new set of knowledge and rigorously test my understanding in note-taking. 

Capturing temporeal information, journaling renders itself not only as a medium for efficiency (to battle forgetfulness, loss, and waste) but also of togetherness. Making me think about the character and depth that is shown to me, and how I should want to grow from there.

### My Implementation
I like highly abstract labels for my journal.

1. luminary - light-giving. navigational (things I want to guide my person with)
2. topograph - lay distance and direction (interesting topics/avenues that I encounter that can't be traced in my current note-taking)
3. sate - answer correlate (questions, curiosities, unknowns)
4. expect - prompt inspiritment (fertile ground for good ideas, things that must be thought further to achieve their true value)
5. kairos - epiphanic (epiphanies, insights, revolutions in understandings)
6. note - flourish, imprint, bequeath (a fleeting note OR a note unfolding with slow progress)
7. prose - invocation, assistance (beautiful pieces of prose that i would like to keep)
8. vocabulary - unique, usable 
9. image - fractional vision (beautiful images shown in my imagination. a way to honor that aspect of myself)
10. read - intent and interest preserved

It suits my journal, which is equal, alongside my other note mediums.

But, it is the most special (loyal to my mind and thinking). I've realized I needed something like this to convey easily between my detached, free-floating state of mind and the ones that are more realistic and structured, adapted for writing, which satisfying the parts of myself that both want roam and rigor. 

.... Anyways enjoy this I guess. `@lofti lofi` in the Obsidian discord if you need help :)

Thanks to `@shabegom`, `@AB1908`, and `@Luke` for help on my label template.
