## Notes

### Summary

This setup consists of three elements: 1) the [[YYYY-MM-DD|daily note]], the [[log1|filtered views]] (logs), and the navigational aspects (links).

### Navigation
Each log and daily note contains an embed of [[nav]], which contains links to each log. The links are contained in a collapsed callout.

### Dataview Queries
[[log1]], [[log2]], and [[log3]] each use three different relevant queries. [[log3]] uses an inline field in each entry to yield narrower filters. 

`[field:: key]` and `(field:: key)` are both inline queries but either show both the values of the field and the key or only the key.

### Template
The most important is the [[label]] template, which adds a link-label to every journal entry containing a link to the corresponding log. Hotkey for template (Windows):  `Ctrl + X`

### Notes on journaling, and how it meshes with my note-taking in Obsidian

My notes are a linearized form of my thinking. Being so refined, they don't seep potential or feed curiosity in a way that a less well-written, subconscious piece would. My journal is situated in such a way to convey this gulf between my notes and my mind with something in between to preserve and distribute horrible pieces of interesting writing that make me excited to both explore a new set of knowledge and rigorously test my understanding in note-taking. 

Capturing temporeal information, journaling renders itself not only as a medium for efficiency (to battle forgetfulness, loss, and waste) but also of togetherness. Making me think about the character and depth that is shown to me, and how I should want to grow from there.

.... Anyways enjoy this I guess. `@lofti lofi` in the Obsidian discord, if you need help.
